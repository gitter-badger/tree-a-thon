I got a chance to talk to Jamie Zarate from Trees For Houston today. He is a project manager.

He had the following comments:

1. Their interest is in a map of their trees to show clients that displays their impact on the city/community.
  a. Ideally they would have an icon on the map for each of the trees or even something as simple as a number of trees for each zip code
2. They use a contractor for watering a portion of the trees (2,000 to 3,000 per work week). This costs ~75 cents per tree.
  a. They have the contractor water 2,000 to 3,000 trees per work week.
3. In the database, the volume dimension (e.g. 20 gallon) is the size of the pot that the tree is planted in, not the water requirement.
4. Maintenance mainly deals with tree upkeep (e.g. pruning and landscaping). Once per year for each tree
5. Several of the smaller trees must be manually watered (by the contracting company) each week until they are 2 years old; then they can survive on their own.

To summarize:
I think the map that Amanda and Justin made already covers the majority of their request. 
I sent him the link to the map and to the gif so he could look at it and send us his feedback.
I think all we may need to do is work on optimizing the map to help it display the data more quickly and allow for quicker traversing.
We could also change the icon structure to show that a large quantity of trees are at some locations.
